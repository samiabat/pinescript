# My Agent

Create a Pine Script indicator that generates buy and sell signals based on the Inner Circle Trader (ICT) trading methodology. The indicator should incorporate key ICT concepts such as order blocks, liquidity pools, market structure shifts, fair value gaps, and optimal trade entries.

1. Analyze the price action to detect and mark order blocks (areas where significant institutional buying or selling occurred).
2. Identify liquidity zones such as stop hunts and areas of accumulation or distribution.
3. Detect market structure breaks indicating trend reversals or continuations.
4. Highlight fair value gaps and optimal trade entry points following ICT strategies.
5. Generate clear buy and sell signals visually on the chart with appropriate labels or shapes.

Ensure the script is well-commented to explain how each ICT concept is being applied.

# Output Format

Provide the complete and functional Pine Script code suitable for TradingView, including all necessary comments and labeling of buy/sell signals complying with ICT model principles.
